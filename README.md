**Pathfinder** is a terminal file explorer prototype written in Rust using ratatui.

## Important Notes
- Files will be **permanently deleted** without confirmation prompts
- This is a prototype and bugs in this software can lead to **significant data loss**
- Always be considerate of where you use Pathfinder
- **To be safe, don't run it in an environment where the software can reach data that you don't want to lose**
